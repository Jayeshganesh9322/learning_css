        <p class="box_model4">On the other hand, we denounce with righteous
            indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by
            the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that
            they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue;
            and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through
            weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from
            toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to
            distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is
            untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we
            like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided.
            But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the
            obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have
            to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore
            always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he
            rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he
            endures pains to avoid worse pains</p>
